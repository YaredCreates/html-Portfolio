<h2>My top 3 movies all-times.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>
  Freinds is special because it feels real-like hanging out with people you
  know. The characters are relatable,the humor never gets old, and the
  freindships feel genuine. It's a kind of show you can watch over and over and
  still love.
</p>
<h3>Dhadkan</h3>
<p>
  Dhadkan is a special because it's more than jsut a love story-it's about
  heartbreaking, growth, and finding peace with the past. The intense love
  triangle, emotional performances, and ungorgettable music make it a movie that
  stays with you. It's the kind of film that makes you feel every emotion, from
  pain to hope.
</p>
<h3>Vickigs</h3>
<p>
  Vikings is loved because it pulls you into world of adventure, loyality, and
  brutal battles. The characters feel real, especially Ragnar and his journey
  form a simple farmer to a great warrior. It's not just about fighting-it's
  about ambition, family, and the price of power. Plus, the visuals and
  storytelling make you feel like you're right there in the viking age.
